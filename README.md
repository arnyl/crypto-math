# crypto-math
A repository featuring code that applies number theory to cryptography, designed for study and practice.  
It includes implementations of key algorithms such as:

- [Fast Exponentiation](./fast_exp.py)
- [Modular Inverse](./mod_inverse.py)
- [Rabin-Miller Primality Test](./rabin_miller.py)
- [Prime Number Generation](./prime_gen.py)
- [Factorization](./factorize.py)
- [Discrete Logarithm Solver](./solve_dlp.py)  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(including Brute Force, Baby-Step Giant-Step, and Pollard‚Äôs Kangaroo methods)

### üîç Usage
This repository is intended for cryptography learners and developers exploring mathematical foundations behind encryption techniques.

### üìÇ Structure
You can run each script individually for testing, or integrate them into your own cryptographic tools.
