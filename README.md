# crypto-math
A repository featuring code that applies number theory to cryptography, designed for study and practice.  
It includes implementations of key algorithms such as:

- [Fast Exponentiation](./fast_mod_exp.py)
- [Modular Inverse](./modular_inverse.py)
- [Rabin-Miller Primality Test](./rabin_miller.py)
- [Prime Number Generation](./prime_generation.py)
- [Factorization](./factorization.py)
- [Discrete Logarithm Solver](./solve_dlp.py)  
  

### üîç Usage
This repository is intended for cryptography learners and developers exploring mathematical foundations behind encryption techniques.

### üìÇ Structure
You can run each script individually for testing, or integrate them into your own cryptographic tools.
